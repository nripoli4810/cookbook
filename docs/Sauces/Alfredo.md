# Alfredo

This recipe combines several attempts at alfredo which now produces a lip-smacking result! Unlike other alfredo sauces, this one does not have cream cheese in it.

## Ingredients

| Amount| Ingredient |
|-- | --|
| 1 cup | Heavy Cream |
| 6 T | Butter |
| 1/4-1/2 C | Parmesan Cheese |
| 1 T | Garlic |
| 1 T | Basil |
| 1 T | Oregano |
| 1-2 tsp | Rosemary (or to taste) |
| 1/2 tsp | Pepper (or to taste) |
| 1/4 tsp | Salt (or to taste) |

Powdered or Shredded Parmesan will work for this recipe!

## Directions

1. Using a large skillet with high sides, melt the butter over a medium-low heat.
2. Add heavy cream to the melted butter and heat mixture thoroughly (but not to a boil).
3. Once warm, add parmesan cheese, garlic, salt and pepper.
4. Using a whisk, continue to reduce the sauce over a medium-low heat. For 20-25 minutes, stir frequently to prevent scorching on the bottom of the skillet.
5. When the sauce has reduced to the point that it slowly drips off your whisk (or when you determine it's thick enough), add remaining herbs.
6. Serve!

## Notes:

* If after 25 minutes your sauce still hasn't thickened to your liking, add 1T flour at a time to your sauce. It will take a moment to combine and thicken your sauce, so less is more here.
* Herbs are optional!
