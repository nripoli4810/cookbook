## Directions

1. Add ground meat to large stock pot and begin browning (enameled cast-iron is a good choice).
2. While meat is browning:
    * Dice onion and peppers
    * Drain beans and set aside
    * Mix spices together in small bowl
3. Add garlic, peppers, and onions to meat about halfway through browning process.
4. When the meat is browned and the onions soft, add the un-drained diced tomatoes and tomato paste to the pot and stir them in.
5. Add half of the beans to the pot and stir in half of the spices.
6. Add the rest of the beans, spices, and extras to the pot and heat over medium heat, until warm.
7. Taste, add more seasonings as necessary.
